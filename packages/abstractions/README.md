Coding Guidelines

1. Write interfaces, classes or functions that can be used isomorphically or only on clientside or serverside.
2. Please use the respective directory structure to write the shared abstractions.
3. Please use "Revealing Module Pattern" when exposing functionalities in modules, so that we put in necessary encapsulations.
4. Please try to use modern ECMAScript features and add types to classes and functions as opposed to using "Typescript" only features (like namespaces).

The idea would be to use common coding guidelines and best practices while developing features across pods to promote consistency, good code quality and performance.
