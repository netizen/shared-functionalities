This is an example application that uses the shared UI components from components package and abstracted functionalities from the abstractions package with global theming support for all the components.

Note: This is not a best practice implementation, but rather a Proof Of Concept put together in a short time. I will try to get back to this package and make it an example of best practice implementation at a later point if I get that opportunity and time.
